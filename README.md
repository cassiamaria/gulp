# Gulp.js

Gulp is a JavaScript task automation tool. Tasks such as minifying, optimizing and compiling files, which can be repetitive but necessary for development.

In this project Gulp was used to automate the tasks of SASS, JavaScript, Typescript and a SPA.
I learned the importance of some commands and some of them are: .pipe, .src, gulp.dest... And also how to execute serial and parallel tasks.
